   Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "repositories": [
           "https://github.com/user/repo1.git",
           "https://github.com/user/repo2.git"
       ],
       "language": "python"
   }
   ```

2. **Run the Installer**:
   Execute the installer with the configuration file:
   ```bash
   docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app multi-repo-installer /app/config.json
   ```

3. **Check the Logs**:
   After execution, check the logs for any errors or messages.

## Supported Languages

The Multi-Repo GitHub Docker Installer supports:

- **Python**: Uses `pip` for dependency management.
- **Node.js**: Uses `npm` for dependency management.

You can specify the language in the configuration file to ensure the correct tools are used.

## Error Tracking

The installer logs errors during the cloning, installation, and test execution processes. You can find these logs in the `logs` directory created in the root of your project. This feature helps you quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Cloud Sandboxing

For enhanced security, you can run your projects in a cloud sandbox. This feature isolates your environment, preventing any unwanted changes to your local setup. To enable cloud sandboxing, add the following to your configuration file:
```json
